Summary 
- The Gaming Room desired a template to help plan the development of their game application draw it, where a picture is generated over time and the user has the chance to guess what is being drawn
- I enjoyed exploring the various development styles accross different platforms and how they all correlate/ what enviornments for different platforms are similar
- I really hadn't explored mobile application development and this was insightful to learn more about
- I would probably restructure some of the information regarding differentg OS as I feel like this project helped me get a deeper uunderstanding of different OS 
- The game would generally be best stored in a cloud enviornment as it would be easiest to manage across the various platforms the company wanted to utilize.
